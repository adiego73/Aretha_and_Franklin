# Aretha & Franklin
The goal of the project was to develop a robot that could dance to music from the soul genre with a dance style and a characterisation with clear references to the soul genre and era. We started from a deep analysis of the soul context and the music characteristics of this genre. From that, we developed a basic concept that we then developed over the weeks, reaching a final prototype able to recognize the music, dance and interact with the user. Following the definition of a robot, we try to keep ourselves open-minded and try to define a design coherent with the research and what we want to communicate, and not bound by the common image of a robot.
